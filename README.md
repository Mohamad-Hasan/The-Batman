A training exercise to build a responsive design using CSS, also used Jquery for some dynamics.
I used the help of this tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52s6c4kYx-Y&list=PLDoPjvoNmBAwccMO4JiLP_vJHxJ_NWeqL) to build this website (Elzero webschool), and then made it responsive using media queries.
